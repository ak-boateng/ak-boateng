## Life Principles
- Life is not a zero sum game, "For me to win, you don't have to lose".
- Do what comes your way.
- Life is so good if you put in 100% efforts, the results will show.
- Your are not as bad as you think you are. The ones who appear perfect are not as good as you think they are.
- There's joy in mastery, be proud of what you already know, no matter how little you think it is.
